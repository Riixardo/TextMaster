<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->
## Project Description
TextMaster gives players a prompt where they can respond under limited conditions. The program will judge players on their language skills. Based on the players' answers, TextMaster gives players a score. Players can choose singleplayer or join a lobby with up to 8 people in multiplayer.

### Key Features

#### Home Page
A personalized page with current ranking, recent activity, and profile viewer. Players can join singleplayer/multiplayer games or view the leaderboard using the side menu.

#### Game Creation Page
Before joining a game, the host of the lobby can choose different conditions for the game. This includes difficulty, timed, or lobby visibility.
